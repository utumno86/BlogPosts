Getting Into Tech
=================

I started with almost no coding background and went through a bootcamp called The Iron Yard. TIY was regional, but these coding bootcamps exist all over the place. The bootcamp itself is now defunct, but the people who were involved with the Tampa/St.Pete campus went on to start the [Suncoast Developer's Guild](https://suncoast.io/), which has it's own bootcamp. Attending a bootcamp was a big time commitment and expensive, but it was very valuable for establishing connections with the community, and it was ultimately through connections with them that I got both of the developer positions I've held.

A couple of caveats though. Since there aren't really any certifications or anything, basically what you are buying when you go to these things is knowledge and connections. You can get both elsewhere and more cheaply; it's just a matter of how much structure and people pointing you in the right direction you need. By the same token, you can go through one of these programs and come out unemployable (I know several people who did). Basically if you go in, you have to give it your all and make sure that you come up with something great for your final project so that you can present it to potential employers.

All that said, here are a couple of pieces of advice to get you started. I develop on a Mac using OSX and Linux, and developing on PC is a slightly different animal that I don't know much about. The specifics are for Mac stuff, but general principles are still applicable to Windows, especially recently.

1) **Get a profile up on [Github](https://github.com/).**

Github is a hosting site for open source code projects, so when you actually start coding you want to have something impressive up on there. Your Github profile is the main thing that a potential employer is going to look at as evidence that you know what you are doing. It also helps if you make contributions to other open source projects on Github. So start coming up with projects to work on and put them on there. Your coding projects don't need to be original; the point is to show technical ability and not to try to build the next big thing. If you are trying to learn a new language by building an app it is totally fine to just rebuild an app you already wrote in a new language.

2) **Make connections with the developers in your community.**

 Tampa/St.Pete, for example, has the Suncoast Developer's Guild (which contains Suncoast.js and The Tampa Ruby Brigade as part of it's greater umbrella). Alternatively, you can just troll Meetup.com for local meetups for Ruby, Python, Javascript, Java, or .Net. Coding meetups are great for meeting people that can help you with specific coding problems, and they are also crucial for making connections that can get you a job later. Most new hires (at least in Tampa) get in through word of mouth.

3) **Be nice to recruiters**

There's a lot of animosity towards recruiters in the tech field, and as soon as you put your profile up on [Dice](https://www.dice.com/) you'll see why. Even with zero experience you will receive constant calls and emails from recruiting firms trying to get you to move to Baltimore or wherever for a short-term contract gig. You probably want to avoid those people, but do some research on local recruiting firms and when *they* call you at least talk to them. You never know when they can land you a job.

The backbone of all this is that you have to actually know what you are doing in an application, though, and that will take some work. Here's some steps toward getting those open source projects.

4) **Learn the OSX/Linux command line.**

There are a couple of skills indirectly related to coding that you need to know before you start actually doing much coding. [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line) has a pretty good command line tutorial that you can access for free. You don't have to be an expert, but all of your programs are going to be activated through command line so you need to at least know how to navigate and run scripts.

5) **Install Homebrew**

If you develop on a Mac [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is ubiquitous. Install it, and install all of your programming stuff through it.

6) **Get a text editor that you like.**

 All of your coding is going to be done through a text editor with code syntax highlighting, so you need to be comfortable with one. [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) is a really simple one with zero bells and whistles. I used to recommend [Atom](https://atom.io/) for a text editor that could be simple but has a lot of bells and whistles you can install, but these days Atom has been mostly supplanted by [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (which is what I am currently using). If you really like a text editor that can do a lot of stuff and are willing to shell out the money, [Jetbrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/products.html?fromMenu) has a full on Integrated Development Environment for all occasions.

7) **Learn git.**

git is a command line based Version Control system which is pretty universally used for keeping track of code changes in industry. There's a tutorial on codecademy. There's also a some good tutorials over on [Github guides](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/). git is how you get your projects on Github. I recommend learning the command line commands, but there are GUIs out there if they make you more comfortable, from [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) to, if you are willing to shell out the money, [GitKracken](https://www.gitkraken.com/).

8) **Learn HTML/CSS**

  Even if you plan on being primarily a back end developer and don't have much aptitude for making things pretty, if you are going into web development you will most likely be positioned as (functionally) a full stack developer. That means you need to know how web pages are constructed, and to do that you need to have a fundamental understanding of HTML and CSS. There are a wide variety of HTML/CSS tutorials on the Internet, but Codecademy has a few. Build a few static websites, try to make a copy of a simple one like [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/). If, like me, you have no knack for making pages pretty, it might behoove you to learn a common CSS library like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) or [MaterializeCSS](https://materializecss.com/).

9) **Pick a programming language and learn it reasonably well.**

Picking your first language is important but maybe not as important as you think. In the long run most languages and patterns are pretty similar, and eventually you will have an arsenal of 5 or 6 major coding languages and dozens of smaller ones. In the short term, however, you will want to focus all of your effort into learning one. For starting out your choices are basically Ruby, Python, Javascript, and Java. If you are developing on Windows, you will want to look into .Net, which is a suite of development tools primarily using C++ and C#. You might want to look at job postings in your area to see what is in highest demand; I can only speak to what it's like in Tampa.

- Javascript is experiencing a boom, as tooling and frameworks for JS in front end development are being released at an alarming rate. Plus, since JS is used in almost every front end and even sites that don't have a full on back end have need for front end developers, there tend to be plenty of JS jobs to go around. That said, I think it's difficult to learn, and the sheer number of choices can be overwhelming for a beginner.

- Python is also in high demand, and it's easy to learn, and it has a lot of tooling. That said, it's scope in web development is pretty small; it tends to be used more to write data science applications and devops scripts, as well as in security and IoT systems than for web development.

- Ruby is a really elegant language and it's easy to learn, and I like it a lot, but it's not as easy to get a job in. (That said, Ruby has Rails, which is a web application platform that's very easy to pick up).

- Java is a bit of a dinosaur and I can't say much to recommended it except that a lot of old enterprise level applications are written in it and there are a lot of high paying jobs to be had working in it. My first professional gig was in a Java offshoot called [Groovy](http://groovy-lang.org/).

- Like Java, .Net is huge for a lot of older enterprise systems, and depending on your area there might be a lot of openings for it at big companies.

I recommend codecademy for the sort of beginner stuff on those languages. Once you have the basics down, you can ramp up your skills doing coding exercises. I personally really like [Exercism](https://exercism.io/) but it has a steep learning curve. [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/) is also really popular.

10) **Build a web app.**

Once you have the language down you want to be able to actually do something with it. As a web developer you probably want to build a web application. This part is probably going to be the most involved, but there are lots of options for tutorials on the Internet. I like a lot of the tutorials on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) (Although, pro tip: wait until there's a sale and don't pay more than like 10 to 12 dollars for a course.) You can also buy a book (although be careful with the edition and make sure you've got something up-to-date: things move fast in tech and sometimes a book that's even 6 months old can be so obsolete as to be useless). I'm a fan of [The Pragmatic Programmers](https://pragprog.com/).
- As mentioned there are a lot of options in Javascript, but probably you'll want to build a front-end application in [React](https://reactjs.org/). If you are looking to build a JS backend, you'll want to use [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). A popular backend Node framework is [Expess.js](https://expressjs.com/). There are also free resources for learning Node at [Node School](https://nodeschool.io/).

- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is the main web framework for Python, although there is a simpler one out now called [Flask](https://www.palletsprojects.com/p/flask/)

- [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) is of course, the main focus of development in Ruby.

11) **Get your web app live.**

For fast and easy app hosting for something with a backend component (and particularly for Rails) nothing beats [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) (which is now owned by Salesforce). Heroku has the benefit of solid documentation to get almost any project off the ground and a generous free tier, but it is kind of a bitch to debug and fix if something goes wrong. Alternately, [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) offer similar services, although I am not as familiar with them. For a lightweight app with no back end component, you can use [surge](https://surge.sh/).

Now that you have a working web application live on the Internet it's time to start building a profile site that links to it and your resume. That site is the link you put in your LinkedIn and Dice profiles to show to potential employers. For an example, mine can be found [here](http://michaelenash.com). Good luck!
